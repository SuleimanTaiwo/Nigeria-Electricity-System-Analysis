# Nigeria Electricity System Analysis (2000–2024)

**Data-driven analysis of Nigeria’s electricity generation, emissions, and renewable energy transition**, evaluated against the Nigeria Energy Transition Plan (ETP).

---

##  Executive Summary

Between 2000 and 2024, Nigeria’s electricity system remained heavily fossil-dependent and slow to decarbonize.

- Fossil fuels increased from **~62% → ~77%**, while renewables declined from **~38% → ~23%**
- Electricity generation stagnated around **35–40 TWh/year**, far below the ETP target of a **6.5× increase by 2060**
- Carbon intensity stayed high at **~500–550 gCO₂/kWh**
- Nigeria must rapidly scale renewables, expand grid capacity, and mobilize large-scale investment to align with its **net-zero 2060** pathway

---

##  Problem Statement

Nigeria’s electricity sector faces three major structural challenges:

1. **Rising fossil share**  
   Natural gas remains dominant, with no visible decline trend.

2. **Declining renewable share**  
   Hydro and other renewables have underperformed over the last two decades.

3. **Persistently high carbon intensity**  
   Emissions per kWh remain elevated compared to transition benchmarks.

These trends conflict with the Energy Transition Plan targets of:
- **82% renewable electricity by 2050**
- **277 GW installed capacity by 2060**

## Insights (2000–2024)

| Indicator | 2000 | 2024 | Trend |
|--------|------|------|------|
| Fossil share of generation | 61.7% | 76.9% | ↑ Increased dependence |
| Renewable share | 38.3% | 23.0% | ↓ Falling contribution |
| Electricity generation | ~14 TWh | ~40 TWh | ↔ Modest growth |
| Carbon intensity | ~411 gCO₂/kWh | ~507 gCO₂/kWh | ↑ Still high |
| Electricity contribution to GHG | Rising | Rising | ↑ Growing impact |

**Interpretation**
- The electricity mix is becoming **dirtier, not cleaner**
- Renewables lost ground due to underinvestment in hydro and solar
- Generation growth remains far below demand and ETP scaling needs

##  Benchmarking vs Nigeria’s Energy Transition Plan (ETP)

| Metric | Current (2024 est.) | ETP Target (2050–2060) |
|------|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Renewable share of capacity | 23% | 82% by 2050 | 
| Installed capacity | ~15 GW | 277 GW by 2060 | 
| Solar PV | <2 GW | 209 GW by 2060 | 
| Hydro | ~2 GW | 11 GW by 2060 | SEforALL |
| Battery storage (BESS) | ≈ 0 GW | 130 GW by 2060 |
| Hydrogen capacity | None | 36 GW by 2060 | 
| Electricity generation | ~40 TWh | 6.5× increase by 2060 | 

**Conclusion**  
Nigeria’s current pace of electricity-sector growth is **not aligned** with its 2050–2060 net-zero trajectory unless renewable deployment accelerates sharply.

---

##  Recommendations

1. **Scale utility-scale renewables (Solar PV + Hydro)**  
   Reverse the 24-year decline in renewable share.

2. **Invest in grid infrastructure & storage (BESS + Hydrogen)**  
   Target **130 GW BESS** and **36 GW hydrogen** capacity by 2060.

3. **Loss reduction**  
   Enhance smart metering rollout to reduce losses and improve consumption tracking.

4. **Strengthen Policy & Finance**  
   Nigeria has made policy, regulatory, and market strides toward a cleaner energy future, but implementation gaps remain, especially for solar, wind, and bioenergy.
